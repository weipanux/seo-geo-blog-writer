# E-E-A-T Guidelines
## Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness

E-E-A-T is Google's framework for evaluating content quality. Originally E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), Google added "Experience" in December 2022 to emphasize first-hand knowledge.

## Why E-E-A-T Matters

**For SEO:**
- Core ranking factor for Google
- Especially important for YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics
- Affects how Google evaluates your entire site, not just individual pages

**For GEO:**
- AI models trained to prefer authoritative sources
- Citation-worthy content requires strong E-E-A-T signals
- Expertise and credentials make content more quotable

**For Users:**
- Builds trust and credibility
- Increases conversion rates
- Reduces bounce rates
- Encourages social sharing

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Experience (First-Hand Knowledge)

**What It Means:**
Content created by someone who has directly experienced the topic. This is the "I actually did this" factor.

**Examples of Strong Experience Signals:**

**Product Reviews:**
```markdown
❌ Weak: "The iPhone 15 Pro has a good camera according to reviews."

✅ Strong: "I've been using the iPhone 15 Pro as my daily driver for 3 months. Here's what I found: The 48MP main camera captures excellent detail in daylight, though low-light performance still trails dedicated cameras. I tested it side-by-side with my Sony A7 III – here are the comparison shots..."
```

**How-To Guides:**
```markdown
❌ Weak: "To start a podcast, you need equipment and a hosting platform."

✅ Strong: "When I launched my podcast in 2023, I made three costly mistakes that cost me $2,000 and 6 months. Here's the exact process I wish I'd followed: First, I tested 5 different microphones in my home office setup. The Audio-Technica AT2020 ($99) delivered 90% of the quality of the $400 Shure SM7B for my room acoustics..."
```

**Case Studies:**
```markdown
✅ Strong: "In Q4 2023, I implemented this exact email strategy for my e-commerce client. Results: 156% increase in revenue ($42K to $107K monthly), 34% higher open rates, and 28% improvement in CTR. Here's the complete breakdown with screenshots from Google Analytics..."
```

**How to Demonstrate Experience:**

**Visual Proof:**
- Screenshots of tools/dashboards you used
- Photos of processes or testing
- Before/after comparisons
- Video demonstrations
- Time-stamped results

**Specific Details:**
- Exact numbers and dates
- Tools and resources used
- Challenges encountered
- Time invested
- Costs involved
- Mistakes made and lessons learned

**Personal Narrative:**
- "I did X and found Y"
- "In my testing..."
- "When I tried this approach..."
- "After 3 months of using this..."

**What NOT to Do:**
- Claim experience you don't have
- Use stock photos pretending they're yours
- Copy someone else's experience
- Make up case studies or results

### 2. Expertise (Knowledge and Skill)
